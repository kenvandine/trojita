Initial attempts to create an Ubuntu Touch interface for Trojita.

Instructions to build and run:
Change into the source directory
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake .. -DUBUNTUTOUCH=1
$ make
$ cd ../src/UbuntuTouch
$ ../../build/trojita-tp

trojita-tp needs to be run from the src/UbuntuTouch directory to load the 
qml files, there aren't install targets setup for it in cmake yet.
