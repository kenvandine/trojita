Initial attempts to create an Ubuntu Touch interface for Trojita.

Instructions to build and run:
Change into the source directory
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake .. -DUBUNTUTOUCH=1
$ make
$ cp -rp ../src/UbuntuTouch/qml ../src/UbuntuTouch/emailclient.qml .
$ ./trojita-tp

The cp step is currently needed for trajita-tp to load the qml files, there 
aren't install targets setup for it in cmake yet.
