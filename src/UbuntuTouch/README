Initial attempts to create an Ubuntu Touch interface for Trojita.

Install instructions:
Change into the source directory
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ qmake CONFIG+=ubuntu_touch ../trojita.pro
$ make
$ make install

The added 'make install' step is to deploy the 'qml' and 'resources' folders with the build.
